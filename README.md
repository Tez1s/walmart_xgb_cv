## Project Overview

This repository demonstrates an **end-to-end feature engineering pipeline** and **XGBoost modeling** workflow focused on forecasting weekly sales for **Store¬†#1** only.  

**All work including previously done feature engineering in this project was performed by _Tez1s_.**

It includes:

- Loading pre-processed data for Store¬†#1  
- A suite of engineered features capturing seasonality, holidays, rolling trends, and interactions  
- Training an XGBoost regressor with time‚Äëaware cross‚Äëvalidation  
- Evaluation of model performance in terms of RMSE and MAE  

> **Note:** All feature engineering was performed by me prior to this project; here you see only the downstream pipeline (features ‚Üí model).

## Data & Sample

Data used in this repo is already cleaned and filtered to **Store¬†#1**. After feature engineering, each row represents one week‚Äôs record:

| Date       | Weekly_Sales | Holiday_Flag | Temperature | Fuel_Price |    CPI     | Unemployment | Month | is_holiday | pre_holiday | post_holiday | Weekly_Sales_MA30 | holiday_sales_impact | temp_fuel_interaction | Day | Lag1_Day |
|------------|-------------:|-------------:|-----------:|-----------:|-----------:|-------------:|------:|-----------:|------------:|-------------:|-----------------:|---------------------:|-----------------------:|----:|---------:|

## Installation

1. **Clone the repository**  
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/Tez1s/walmart_xgb_cv.git
   cd walmart_xgb_cv

## Feature Engineering

**All features have been pre‚Äëcomputed and bundled into `final_walm.csv`:**

- **Rolling Mean (30‚Äëday)**  
  - `Weekly_Sales_MA30`: 30‚Äëday moving average of `Weekly_Sales`.
  
- **Holiday Effects**  
  - `is_holiday`: 1 if the week contains a holiday, else 0  
  - `pre_holiday` / `post_holiday`: Flags for the weeks immediately before and after a holiday  
  - `holiday_sales_impact`: Difference between actual sales and the rolling mean during holiday weeks
  
- **Interaction Terms**  
  - `temp_fuel_interaction`: Product of `Temperature` and `Fuel_Price` to capture joint effects
  
- **Lag Features**  
  - `Lag1_Day`: Sales from the previous week (weekly lag)
  
- **Date Components & Economic Indicators**  
  - `Month`  
  - `Day`  
  - `Holiday_Flag` (original Kaggle flag)  
  - `Temperature`, `Fuel_Price`, `CPI`, `Unemployment`

## Modeling

### Algorithm **XGBoost Regressor** (`xgboost.XGBRegressor`)
- base_score=0.5
- booster='gbtree'
- n_estimators=1000
- early_stopping_rounds=50
- max_depth=3
- learning_rate=0.01

### Cross‚ÄëValidation  
- **TimeSeriesSplit** with `n_splits=5`, ensuring each validation fold only trains on past data
- **Each fold trains the model on an increasing subset of data, maintaining temporal order**  

### Evaluation Metrics  
- **RMSE** (Root Mean Squared Error)  
- **MAE** (Mean Absolute Error)

---

## Results

**Model Performance on Store¬†#1 Weekly Sales Forecasting:**

- **üìâ RMSE**: `19,274.35`  
- **üìà MAPE**: `1.13%`

These results indicate strong predictive performance, with the model capturing weekly sales trends with high accuracy and minimal percentage error.
